## Week 0

In this initial phase, we will be focusing on Python and related libraries to build a strong foundation for time series forecasting. The resources provided in this section will help you understand the basics of Python programming, data handling with Numpy and Pandas, and visualization with Matplotlib. Additionally, we will introduce you to PyTorch, a popular deep learning library, which will be used to implement Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting.

### Environment Setup

It is suggested that you use Google Colab for this project. You can access it by clicking [here](https://colab.research.google.com/). If you want to use your local machine, you can install Python using Miniconda/Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).

### Python

An introduction to using Python for time series analysis, covering essential scripting, data handling techniques, and foundational programming practices required for effective forecasting.

### Numpy/Pandas/Matplotlib

Resources and practical examples for:

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html): Performing efficient numerical operations and array manipulations.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html): Data cleaning, exploration, and preparation for data analysis.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/quick_start.html): Visualizing data for exploratory analysis and trend observation.

It is suggested that you learn to Google and to use ChatGPT, as they help you to solve your queries and get you the resources you need.

### PyTorch

Guidance on using PyTorch for initial model setup and exploration of neural network concepts as a foundation for more complex models like LSTMs.
Follow sections 1 to 7 at [PyTorch - Learn the Basic](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)

## Week 1

### LSTM

Detailed steps for implementing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for handling dependencies in time series data:

- Explanation of the LSTM architecture and why it is suitable for forecasting.
- A tutorial on building an LSTM model using PyTorch.
- Analysis and interpretation of model performance to evaluate effectiveness.
